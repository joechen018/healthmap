You are a healthcare industry expert. Based on the following information about multiple healthcare entities, please infer additional relationships between them that might not be explicitly stated.

Entities:
{{entities_json}}

For each entity, add or update the "relationships" array with any additional relationships you can infer based on industry knowledge and the data provided.

Return ONLY a JSON array of the updated entities, with no additional text.

For relationship types, use: owned_by, owns, partner, competitor, customer, vendor

Consider the following types of relationships that might exist:
1. Competitive relationships between entities of the same type (e.g., payers compete with other payers)
2. Customer/vendor relationships between different types (e.g., providers are customers of vendors)
3. Ownership relationships based on parent/subsidiary information
4. Partnership relationships that might exist based on industry knowledge

Be comprehensive but avoid speculating too much. Only add relationships that are likely to exist based on the data provided or common industry knowledge.
